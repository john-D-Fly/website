curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/decentrafly/feed/main/bin/adsblol-init | bash cd /opt/adsblol/ cp .env.example .env Then, set the environment variables.
You can either edit the .env file, or run adsblol-env set &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;

Feeding directly to other aggregators # Where possible, Decentrafly.org commits to share data and ingest data directly with other aggregators which are willing to license their data openly.
The adsblol service can feed to other aggregators.

WARNING: ADSBexchange has recently been acquired by a private equity company with unknown plans for the data submitted. It does however have the largest MLAT network, giving you the best chance to locally identify overhead aircraft that do not explicitly share their location data.
