## Sharing Is Caring

For the benefit of the community, Decentrafly.org shares aggregated data with other aggregators who are willing to do the same.

## How It Works

We mutually share aggregated BEAST and MLAT data.

No PII (personal information) is exchanged.

Aggregators with an interest in open data and a sizeable coverage are encouraged to join.

By sharing data with Decentrafly.org, you agree to license your data as [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/).

In exchange, you get access to the aggregated data of all the other aggregators, including Decentrafly.org, licensed to you as [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/).

This way, everyone benefits from the aggregated data of everyone else.
